                    <h2>API Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>To provide usage statistics, we store basic information about your queries (counters for
                        successful and failed queries, for resolved countries) for the duration of your subscription,
                        and for up to 1 year after your subscription has ended.

                        We store access logs (such as your IP address, ip/domain being queried, API key) for a maximum
                        of 24 hours, and we will never share this data with any other company or provider. These logs
                        are used only for troubleshooting issues you may have.</p>

                    <p>This is a summary of our full privacy policy and it applies to clients of <%=locals.APP_NAME%>.

                            <h3>Client data</h3>

                            <p>
                                For legal and operational reasons we will store billing data that you submit to us (such
                                as
                                company details, full name, email address and postal address) for the duration of your
                                subscription, and for up to 1 year after your subscription has ended.
                                We do not store your payment information (such as full credit card numbers). When
                                placing an
                                order, for the sole purpose of processing payments, we will transmit your billing data
                                (company
                                name, full name, email address and postal address) to our payment processors Netopia

                                We will not sell or give away any of your personal information to any third party, but
                                we
                                may
                                share your personal information and access logs to comply with applicable laws and
                                regulations

                                If there ever were to be a breach of personal data, we will inform impacted parties
                                within
                                24

                            <p>
                                We use cookies strictly to keep track of authenticated clients. We do not set any
                                third-party
                                cookies.
                                We collect and store basic information about your requests to this website (such as IP
                                address,
                                browser agent, referring site, date and time of each request and other activities) for

                    <h2>Terms of Service
                    </h2>
                    <p>These terms apply to clients of <%=locals.APP_NAME%> and API calls to the <%=locals.APP_NAME%>
                                endpoint.

                                <h3>Acceptable Use Policy</h3>

                                <p>
                                    You can query the <%=locals.APP_NAME%> pro endpoint for an unlimited amount of times
                                        for
                                        the duration that your
                                        subscription is active.
                                        We reserve the right to block your API keys or disable your subscription if we
                                        believe you are
                                        querying the API in an intentionally excessive or abusive manner, for example,
                                        if
                                        you're querying
                                        all possible IPv4 addresses for database mining purposes.
                                        We do not allow reselling of your API keys, subscription, or data returned by
                                        the
                                        API.
                                        You are responsible for keeping your API keys private. We recommend setting
                                        restrictions for your
                                        API keys, so eventual key leaks will prevent potential API abuse.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Response time</h3>

                                <p>
                                    We use various techniques to offload, failover and balance traffic to multiple
                                    physical servers
                                    located around the world. The pro endpoint has a response time of less than 500ms in
                                    most populated
                                    areas of the world, and under 100ms in Europe, USA and most of Asia.
                                    If you consistently experience higher latencies, we will deploy servers to better
                                    serve your area.
                                    Please submit a request at contact@<%=locals.APP_URL%>.
                                </p>

                                <h3>SLA</h3>

                                <p>
                                    We strive for a 100% API uptime. However, if the uptime falls below 99.9% in a
                                    subscription month,
                                    or if the response time is consistently (for more than 1 hour) over 500ms, we
                                    will automatically
                                    extend your subscription for 10 days.
                                    If your subscription is not automatically extended you can submit a request at
                                    contact@<%=locals.APP_URL%>
                                        with supporting documentation, such as log files showing the
                                        non-availability of the API.
                                        The SLA will not apply in the following cases: failure of network routes
                                        outside of our control,
                                        Denial of Service attacks, or suspension of your account or API keys.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Data</h3>

                                <p>
                                    We use multiple sources for populating our database, including BGP, RIR, ISP
                                    and data sharing
                                    agreements, geofeeds and latency-based tracking.
                                    For some IP ranges we fallback to GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind,
                                    available from www.maxmind.com
                                    We do our best effort to return accurate data, but the information returned
                                    may contain errors or be
                                    inaccurate. We do not offer any warranties regarding the correctness of the
                                    data returned by the
                                    <%=locals.APP_URL%> pro endpoint.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Billing</h3>

                                <p>
                                    There is no commitment and no automatic renewal. You can stop paying at
                                    any time.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Refunds</h3>

                                <p>
                                    You can request a full refund within 14 days from the day of payment by
                                    submitting a request at
                                    contact@<%=locals.APP_URL%>. Refunds will be provided in the same way
                                        that the initial payment was made (e.g.
                                        credit card payments will be refunded directly to the same credit
                                        card).
